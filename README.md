# Python Crash Course
In this repository, I solve all the problems that appear in [Python Crash Course](https://pythonbooks.org/python-crash-course-a-hands-on-project-based-introduction-to-programming/) by Eric Matthes.
Each chapter.py file will contain the solutions for that particular chapter.
The problems corresponding to each solution is commented next to each block of code.
To run this program simply pull it from github and ensure that Python 3.6 is set as the project interpreter.

This was a personal goal of mine to teach myself how to program in Python after teaching myself VBA and macros in Excel.
I am thankful of the knowledge I learned from this book as it is the cornerstone to the good programming practices I use today.

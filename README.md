# Python Crash Course
In this repository, I solve all the problems that appear in [Python Crash Course](https://pythonbooks.org/python-crash-course-a-hands-on-project-based-introduction-to-programming/) by Eric Matthes.
This was a personal goal of mine to teach myself how to program in Python in fall 2017 after teaching myself VBA and macros in Excel.

After solving all the problems in the textbook over several weeks, I eventually would apply the skills I learn in this book
to program another personal project called Python RTS. I am very thankful of
the knowledge I learned from this book as it is the cornerstone to the good programming practices I still use
to this day.

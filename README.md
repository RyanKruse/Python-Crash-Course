# Python Crash Course
In this repository, I solve all the problems that appear in [Python Crash Course](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018UXJ9RI) by Eric Matthes.
This was a personal goal of mine to teach myself how to program in Python back in early 2018 and determine how capable I was as a programmer.

After solving all the problems in the textbook over the summer, I eventually would apply the skills I learn in this book
to program another personal project called [Python RTS](https://github.com/RyanKruse/Python-RTS). I am very thankful of 
the knowledge I learned from this book as it is the cornerstone to the good programming practices I still apply
to this day. It also taught me that programming can be fun, and gave me the motivation to re-enroll back in college to
complete a B.S. of Computer Science.
